# Lucony Money Tracker - Smart Financial Tracking App

**Technology Stack: **

**Note: The site may take a bit long to launch if it hasn't been launched for long time as I'm only using free plans on Render and Vercel. Please be patient as it should be live in a minute or so**

## Motivation


## Note to myself

1. Deploy the client side to Vercel and deploy the server side to Render
2. When deploying angular project to Vercel, make sure the output directory points to the folder containing the html file
3. "align-text-top" native tailwind class doesn't help text appear from the top of the input.
4. If I useState(props), it will read the props one time when the component is first mounted. If props get changed in the parent component, useSate will ignore it and keeps the old value.
